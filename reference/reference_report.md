CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. The urgency and objective of the topic
In the distant past, a meteorite of enormous size flew through the Earth’s atmosphere
and crashed into the blue planet; the collision vaporized mineral fragments from the ground
and flew into the sky. The molten minerals floated in the air like sparkling raindrops, each
one traveling thousands of kilometres before falling back to the ground. Or even way
further, the collision of two hot “red balls” caused to form the Earth and the Moon
nowadays, with the Earth carrying a lot of minerals with it. After millions of years buried
under layers of rock, these shiny mineral fragments occasionally rose to the surface to tell
of the vastness of the Earth and the immensity of time. Geology is the study, the
combination of the knowledge about how rock forms after a thousand of years, how
fascinating a gemstone can be made under pressure and temperature, how the minerals are
formed, and also the fossils, the heritages as well. The earth was formed about 4.6 billion
years ago, so there must be some kind of beautiful formation of rare rocks, or even
gemstones hidden somewhere in the earth. Therefore, learning about the theory of rocks,
minerals through books will only get us halfway through the actual knowledge of earth
geology. President Ho Chi Minh has taught us: "Learning must go hand in hand with
practice. It is useless to study without practice; if you don't learn, you won't be fluent”.
Therefore, on June 6th, we went on a trip to visit the Ho Chi Minh City Geological Museum
as part of a learning activity, to practice observing and understanding the geological history
of Viet Nam, with the formation of rocks, ores, minerals, and even gemstones too.
1.2. General history about Ho Chi Minh City Geological Museum
Going back in time, in 1898, the colonial government established the Service Géologique
de l’Indochine and wanted to build a museum for scientific research and geological education
throughout Indochina. By 1914, the first building of the Geological Museum was completed
on the premises of the Geological Service in Hanoi. Then, in 1954, after the Geneva
Agreement, part of the Geological Service and valuable specimens were transferred to Saigon.

Before withdrawing, the French government handed over this collection to the Department of
Mineral Resources of the Republic of Vietnam for management.
After the country was unified, the Geological Museum was assigned to the Southern
Geological Mapping Federation (under the General Department of Geology of Vietnam) for
management. In 2001, the museum (headquartered in Hanoi) became one of the first members
of Vietnam to be recognized by the International Council of Museums. In 2003, the Geological
Museum system was restructured into a specialized agency under the Department of Geology
and Minerals of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. And in 2008, the facility
in Ho Chi Minh City officially merged into the Vietnam Geological Museum system,
becoming the southern branch of the national museum of geology. After the restructuring
process, the Geological Museum is currently under the Department of Geology and Minerals
of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment.
The museum currently holds about 13000 precious geological specimens, of which about
3,000 are on permanent display. Including geological drill cores and archived samples, the
total number of specimens here is more than 20000. The highlight on the ground floor (General
Geology) is the 1:500,000 scale geological map of Vietnam completed in 1988. This large map
shows the geological structure of the entire territory of Vietnam clearly annotated, very useful
for visitors to learn about the diversity of resources and stratigraphy.
1.3. Report objectives and breakdown
This report will illustrate the visit of the Ho Chi Minh City Geological Museum from
our group, particularly Floor 1 and Floor 2. The first floor of the Museum will briefly
introduce the geological evolution of Viet Nam with the geological process, written by
Chau Gia Han and Tran Minh Hang. On the second floor, Tran Tuan Kiet will demonstrate
the fuel, metallic and non-metallic minerals, and I (Nguyen Gia Hy) will illustrate the
gemstone, mineral water and the concept of geological heritage. Throughout this report,
we will organize the information of the geological knowledge and our own experience to
make this report more informative and easier to comprehend.

CHAPTER 2. GENERAL GEOLOGY (1st floor)
2.1. Geological Evolution
The Earth has a long and dynamic history spanning approximately 4.6 billion years.
This evolution is divided into major geological eons and eras, each marked by significant
events such as crust formation, atmospheric changes, biological evolution, and tectonic
activities. The process can be better understood when combined with physical samples and
visual exhibits, such as those observed during our visit to the Geological Museum of Ho
Chi Minh City.
2.1.1. Precambrian Time (Hadean - Archean - Proterozoic; ~4.6 billion - 541 million
years ago)
Hadean Eon (~4.6 - 4.0 Ga): The Earth formed from cosmic dust and gas. During
this period, it was a molten mass with intense meteorite bombardment. The Earth's core
and crust differentiated, and the primitive atmosphere and oceans began to take shape.
Archean Eon (~4.0 - 2.5 Ga): The first stable continental crust formed. The oceans
expanded, and the atmosphere remained anoxic. Life began in the form of anaerobic
bacteria. Cyanobacteria (blue - green algae) emerged near the end of this era and initiated
photosynthesis.
Proterozoic Eon (~2.5 Ga - 541 Ma): This period saw the "Great Oxygenation Event"
(~2.4 Ga), increasing atmospheric oxygen. Eukaryotic (nucleated) cells evolved, setting
the stage for multicellular life. Supercontinents such as Rodinia (~1.0 Ga) and Pannotia
(~600 Ma) formed and broke apart.
In Vietnam, Precambrian rocks are found in:
• The Kon Tum Massif (Central Highlands): hosts orthogneiss and migmatite rocks
dated to ~1.6 billion years, representing the Earth's oldest crustal material.
• Nam Co (Son La - Lai Chau): shows evidence of Proterozoic intracontinental rifting.

At the museum: These ancient rocks are displayed in the “Metamorphic Rocks”
section, providing tangible evidence of Vietnam’s Precambrian foundations.

Figure 1 – Proterozoic rock section
2.1.2. Palaeozoic Era (541 – 252 million years ago)
This era began with the Cambrian Explosion, a massive diversification of marine life.
Later, plants and amphibians colonized land. The era ended with the Permian - Triassic
extinction, the largest known mass extinction, wiping out over 90% of marine species.
In Vietnam:
• Marine sedimentary rocks with abundant fossils (e.g., corals, brachiopods,
trilobites) are found in Northeast Vietnam, such as in Cao Bang and Ha Long Bay.
• The Truong Son (Annamite) Range began forming due to Caledonian and
Hercynian orogenies.
At the museum:
• Fossils of corals, mollusks, and petrified wood from areas like Truong Sa (Spratly
Islands) and northern Vietnam are exhibited.
• Geological maps display Paleozoic strata across northern and central Vietnam.

Figure 2 – Palaeozoic Rock sample
2.1.3. Mesozoic Era (252 – 66 million years ago)
Known as the "Age of Dinosaurs," the Mesozoic saw the rise of reptiles, the breakup
of Pangaea, and generally warm climates. The era ended with the Cretaceous–Paleogene
(K–Pg) extinction caused by the Chicxulub impact and Deccan volcanism.
In Vietnam:
• The Indosinian Orogeny uplifted the Truong Son Range and created sedimentary
basins.
• Volcanic and sedimentary activity occurred in areas like Kon Tum, Son La, and
Thanh Hoa.
• Fossil evidence of dinosaurs and ancient flora has been found in some localities.
At the museum:

• Basalt and volcanic sediment from this era are displayed in the “Magmatism”
section.
• Fossils and stratigraphic profiles reflect the Mesozoic biosphere and tectonic events.

Figure 3 – Volcanic Bomb
2.1.4. Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago – present)
This era features the evolution and dominance of mammals, birds, and eventually
humans. Tectonic faulting, glaciations, and sedimentation shaped modern landforms and
ecosystems.
In Vietnam:
• Major faults like the Red River and Song Ca faults influenced the formation of the
Cuu Long (Mekong) and Red River basins, rich in oil and gas.
• The Quaternary Period (~2.58 Ma - present) witnessed alternating glaciations and
interglacials, forming the Mekong and Red River deltas through alluvial deposition.
At the museum:

• Core samples of crude oil from the Cuu Long basin (collected in the 1980s) are on
display.
• Sediment cores and alluvial rock samples reflect recent geological processes,
showcased in the “Fuel Group” and sedimentary sections.
2.2. Geological Process
Geological processes are natural forces that shape and transform the Earth's surface
and interior over time. During the visit to the Ho Chi Minh City Geological Museum, six
major geological processes were introduced through rock specimens, models, and
diagrams. These processes—from extra terrestrial impacts to deep-earth dynamics and
surface changes—contribute to the formation, alteration, and recycling of Earth materials.
The museum’s displays helped visualize how each process plays a role in creating
different rock types and landforms, offering insight into the dynamic and interconnected
nature of the geological cycle.
2.2.1. Cosmic Process
Although no meteorite samples were displayed during the visit, the cosmic process
remains essential in Earth’s geological history. It refers to extra terrestrial impacts,
especially meteorites, which helped shape the early Earth. These collisions formed craters,
altered surface rocks, and delivered elements like iron, nickel, and platinum - key
components of Earth's crust and core. Despite the lack of exhibits, this process highlights
the planet's cosmic origins and is widely studied through global meteorite discoveries.
2.2.2. Tectonic Process
Tectonic processes involve the movement of the Earth's lithospheric plates. These
dynamic movements are responsible for geological phenomena such as earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions, mountain formation, and continental drift.
At the museum, this process was illustrated through global tectonic maps and a threedimensional model of plate boundaries, showing the locations and interactions between

---

# Page 13

major tectonic plates around the world. These materials effectively demonstrate how plates
move and interact through different boundary types:
•
Divergent boundaries, where plates move apart and new crust forms;
•
Convergent boundaries, where plates collide, leading to subduction and mountain
building;
•
Transform boundaries, where plates slide past each other, often causing
earthquakes.
The exhibit helps explain how these boundary interactions drive geological activity
and continuously shape the Earth's surface.
2.2.3. Magmatic Process
Magmatic processes are responsible for the formation of igneous rocks through the
cooling and solidification of magma. These rocks differ in texture and composition
depending on where and how quickly the magma cools.
In the museum exhibit, igneous rocks were organized into two main groups. Extrusive
rocks, such as basalt and andesite, are formed from lava that cools quickly at the surface,
resulting in fine-grained textures. In contrast, intrusive rocks like granite and diorite
crystallize slowly underground, producing visibly larger mineral grains.

Figure 4 – Basalt Rocks

---

# Page 14

2.2.4. Metamorphic Process
Metamorphic processes occur when rocks are exposed to intense heat, pressure, or
chemically active fluids, causing them to transform into new types of rocks. At the
museum, samples such as schist, gneiss, slate, quartzite, and marble were on display, each
showing different metamorphic conditions.
A notable example is marble, formed from limestone through contact metamorphism.
The exhibit also featured diagrams of metamorphic facies and processes, helping explain
how varying conditions influence rock transformation.

2.2.5. Sedimentary Process
Sedimentary processes involve the accumulation, compaction, and cementation of
materials derived from pre-existing rocks or biological sources. These processes lead to the
formation of sedimentary rocks with layered structures.
•
Mechanical sedimentation includes rocks like sandstone and conglomerate, formed
through the physical breakdown and deposition of rock fragments.
•
Chemical sedimentation is represented by limestone, formed from minerals
precipitating out of solution in water-rich environments.

2.2.6. Weathering Process
Weathering is the process that breaks down rocks at the Earth’s surface due to
exposure to wind, rain, temperature changes, and chemical reactions.
At the museum, this process was illustrated through diagrams and rock samples
showing effects of mechanical weathering (such as rock fragmentation and exfoliation
patterns) and chemical weathering (e.g., iron oxidation on rock surfaces).
These displays highlight how weathering initiates the rock cycle by producing loose
sediments that can later form sedimentary rocks.

CHAPTER 3. MINERAL RESOURCES (2nd floor)
3.1. Fuel Group
The fuel group encompasses naturally occurring energy sources utilized for
combustion to produce heat and power. Two primary categories within this group are
petroleum and various forms of coal.
Petroleum is a liquid fossil fuel derived from the remains of ancient marine life. It is
obtained from underground deposits and refined into several important fuels such as
gasoline, diesel, and kerosene. Petroleum is a key resource in powering transportation,
supporting industrial activities, and generating energy.
Coal, on the other hand, is a solid fossil fuel created from ancient vegetation
compressed over millions of years under heat and pressure. It exists in multiple grades,
based on carbon content and energy potential:
• Peat – the initial stage of coal formation
• Lignite – also known as brown coal
• Bituminous coal – a common, mid-grade coal
• Anthracite – the hardest and most energy-rich form
Coal is predominantly used for electricity generation and also plays a role in industrial
processes like steel manufacturing.

Figure 7 – Coal samples

3.2. Metallic Minerals
Metallic minerals are naturally occurring substances that contain metal elements.
These are extracted from the Earth and processed to isolate metals, which are then utilized
across various sectors such as technology, construction, transportation, and manufacturing.
Some key metallic minerals include:
• Titanium (Ti): Strong, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant; crucial in aerospace and
medical applications.

Figure 19 – Tungsten (W) ore
These minerals are critical for supporting modern infrastructure, technological
innovation, and economic development.
3.3. Non-Metallic Minerals
Non-metallic minerals are naturally occurring substances that do not contain metal
and are used in their natural form in various industries. They are vital to sectors such as
construction, agriculture, and manufacturing.
Examples of common non-metallic minerals:
• Silica sand: A high-purity quartz used in glass manufacturing, foundries, and
construction.
• Pyrite: Often mistaken for gold, this mineral is a major source of sulfur.
• Apatite: Rich in phosphate; mainly used to produce agricultural fertilizers.
• Talc: The softest mineral, used in cosmetics, ceramics, and paper products.
• Asbestos: Previously used for insulation and fireproofing due to its heat resistance;
now limited due to health concerns.
• Phosphorite: A phosphate-rich rock used for fertilizer production.
• Construction materials: Includes limestone, marble, granite, clay, sand, and
gravel—key components in building infrastructure and roads.

• Kaolin (China clay): A white clay used in ceramics, paper, cosmetics, and paint.

Figure 20 – Kaolin Clay
Even without metal content, these minerals are indispensable to many aspects of
modern life and economic activity.
3.4. Gemstones and semi-precious stones
 A gemstone is a piece of mineral crystal that, once cut or polished, is used to create
jewelry or other adornments. Certain non-mineral rocks and organic materials that are used
for jewelry are frequently considered gemstones. Most gemstones are hard, but some softer
minerals, such as brazilianite, can be utilized in jewelry due to its color, luster, or other
aesthetic features. However, soft minerals are rarely used as gemstones due to their
brittleness and lack of durability.
There are some gemstones that are precious like diamonds, ruby, emerald, sapphire,
etc…, the others fall into the category of semi-precious gemstones. Here in museum trip,
we have some gemstones that are captured as below:
3.4.1. Amethyst
Amethyst is a violet variation of quartz (SiO2) that has its color from irradiation, iron
(Fe3+) impurities, and, in some cases, other transition metals, as well as the presence of
other trace elements that cause complex crystal structure replacements. Amethyst is valued

---

# Page 24

19

for its metaphysical traits, which are frequently employed in meditation and spiritual
rituals. It is thought to bring calm, equilibrium, and peace, making it an ideal stone for
healing.

Figure 21 – Amethyst sample
3.4.2. Topaz
Topaz is a rare silicate mineral with a chemical composition of Al2SiO4(F,OH)2.
Common topaz is colorless in its normal condition, but trace element impurities can tint it
pale blue, golden-brown, or yellow-orange. It is cut and polished to create jewelry and
other adornments. Because of its hardness, lower quality topaz is often utilized as an
abrasive material, as well as for the production of refractory materials for high temperature
conditions.

Figure 22 – Topaz Sample

---

# Page 25

20

3.4.3. Ruby
Ruby is a gemstone made of the mineral corundum that ranges in color from pinkishred to blood-red. Ruby is one of the most popular traditional jewelry gems and is extremely
durable. Ruby is one of the classic cardinal gemstones, along with amethyst, sapphire,
emerald, and diamond.
Rubies have the highest per-carat price of any colored stone. This makes ruby one of
the most valuable stones on the colored stone market. Corundum, in its purest form, is
colorless. Color differences occur as trace elements become incorporated into the mineral's
crystal structure. Chromium is the trace element that gives ruby its red color.
Rubies are often used in jewelry, including rings, necklaces, bracelets, and earrings.
Ruby is an aphrodisiac, allowing people to feel all types of love, from wild sensuality to
profound communion. Ruby's powerful vitality sharpens the mind, resulting in increased
awareness and concentration.

3.4.4. Quartz
Quartz is a silica-based material that is hard and crystalline. It is the most abundant
mineral on the globe and can be found in a variety of shapes, including points, masses,
grains, prisms, and even threads. Quartz crystals are commonly hexagonal in shape, having
six sides and a pyramid-shaped termination point. Quartz is often used in jewelry creation
as well as glass manufacture.

# Page 27

22

3.4.5. Chalcedony
Chalcedony is a mineral composed of tiny crystals of quartz. It is a cryptocrystalline
type of silica, which means the crystals are too tiny to view without a microscope.
Chalcedony usually has a waxy or glassy shine and comes in a variety of colors such as
white, gray, blue, and brown. It is commonly used as a gemstone or in jewelry creation, as
well as in the manufacture of a variety of industrial items such as ceramics and abrasives.
Chalcedony can be found all over the world, particularly in volcanic rocks, geodes, and
sedimentary rocks.

Figure 27 – Chalcedon samples
3.5. Mineral water: mineral mines and sources
 On the second floor, we also can see the exhibition of mineral water, collected from
many springs in Viet Nam. The museum has about three dozen mineral water samples with
different characteristics of chemical formulation. Natural mineral water is derived from
underground sources where the water has gently acquired minerals while flowing through
layers of rock over extended periods of time.
Natural sources of water, such as groundwater or surface water (rivers, streams, etc.),
are never simply H2O. They always contain minerals and chemical compounds. For
thousands of years, mankind has used this type of water to relieve their thirst.

---

# Page 28

23

Groundwater can penetrate deep underground, take up precious minerals, and even
heat up in areas where tectonic activity has occurred or is ongoing, such as fault lines or
historic volcanic zones. This method produces mineral-rich or hot springs. These natural
waters are not just remarkable from a geological standpoint; they have also been recognized
for their health advantages and are now popular destinations for ecotourism and wellness
travel in Viet Nam.
In many areas of Vietnam such as Binh Thuan, Ninh Thuan, there are also some
mineral water mines that have been exploited such as Vinh Hao, Van Lam, Ham Cuong,
Da Kai. The most special of which is Vinh Hao mineral water mine, discovered by the
French in 1928 in Vinh Hao, Tuy Phong, Binh Thuan.
Because of the perfect geological conditions of the Southeast Truong Son region,
which has numerous layers of interwoven and interlaced rocks, the mineral source here has
a higher concentration of bicarbonate (HCO3-) dissolved in water than in other regions.
This is an antacid that helps to lower stomach acidity, reducing stomach pain and bloating.
Furthermore, the mineral makeup of Vinh Hao includes silicate dissolved in water, which
has beneficial effects on digestion and nerves; calcium prevents osteoporosis; magnesium
strengthens immunity, improves heart function, and regulates blood pressure, among other
things. These are excellent benefits that not all mineral sources provide. [2]

3.6. Geological heritage
Geological heritage is a collection of geological resources that have exceptional
scientific, educational, artistic, and economic significance. It can refer to a specific spot or
landscape on Earth that preserves evidence and remnants of the Earth's birth and growth,
as well as the evolutionary history of life in a region or area of the globe. Geomorphological
landscapes, paleontological sites, fossils, extinct or active volcanic craters, caves, river
canyons, natural lakes, waterfalls, natural or artificial exposures of rocks and ores,
formations, landscapes that record special geological events and contexts, places where
geological processes can be observed that have occurred and continue to occur, and so on
are some examples. These locations and areas have significant scientific, aesthetic, and
historical importance, as well as the potential to attract tourists. They are referred to
together as geological heritage, which is the most important type of natural heritage.
Geological heritage, like other types of heritage, is a finite resource that must be
maintained, developed, and used in a sustainable manner. [3]

CHAPTER 4. CONCLUSION AND THOUGHTS
 The trip to Ho Chi Minh City Geological Museum was a meaningful experience for
us to experience about the geological evolution of Viet Nam with the geological process
on the first floor, with the demonstration of the fuel, metallic and non-metallic minerals,
the gemstone, mineral water and the concept of geological heritage on the second floor.
Throughout the trip to study at the museum, on the first floor, we have learnt so much
about the history of the Earth, from Precambrian Time up to Cenozoic Era, with the
evidence being the volcanic and sedimentary rocks. We also got the concept of geological
processes such as Cosmic Process, Tectonic Process, Magmatic Process, Metamorphic
Process, Sedimentary Process and Weathering Process. On the second floor, we have a
chance to observe the Mineral Resources wealth of Viet Nam, from fuel, metallic mineral,
non-metallic minerals, to even precious and semi-precious gemstones, mineral waters and
the basic concept of geological heritage.
This museum is a big repository of the minerals and geological rocks that can be used
for educational purposes and also the archive of Vietnamese scientific knowledge. This
museum also brought us an old and chill vibe, that makes us feel like we are living millions
of years in just 2 to 3 hours. We hope that we can have another experience to observe the
geological state of Earth to take care of the Earth more than ever before.
