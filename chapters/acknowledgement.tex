\section*{ACKNOWLEDGEMENT}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{ACKNOWLEDGEMENT}

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to MSc. Dong Uyen Thanh for her guidance and support during our study at the Ho Chi Minh City Geological Museum. Through her lectures and explanations, we gained not only theoretical knowledge but also practical insights into rocks, minerals, and the broader concepts of geology. The detailed stories and real-life examples she shared helped us better understand the subject and connect classroom knowledge with real-world applications.

The experience at the museum has provided us with valuable resources for future projects and strengthened our awareness of the Earth, encouraging us to care for and protect it. In this report, we have done our best to apply the lessons and knowledge received from Ms. Thanh, along with additional reference materials. Despite our efforts, some minor errors in grammar or understanding may remain.

Once again, we sincerely thank MSc. Dong Uyen Thanh for giving us the opportunity to learn through such a meaningful and practical experience.
